Lots has changed with Rails 6 and how stylesheets and javascript are managed. 

My favourite article about this is [this one by Ruby Yagi](https://rubyyagi.com/how-to-use-bootstrap-and-jquery-in-rails-6-with-webpacker/), and as a bonus includes how to make $ available in your app, as well as [select2](https://select2.org/getting-started/basic-usage) and [DateRangePicker](https://www.daterangepicker.com/).

[This article](https://blog.capsens.eu/how-to-write-javascript-in-rails-6-webpacker-yarn-and-sprockets-cdf990387463) provides a great introduction to the new ecosystem and how to include bootstrap and fontawesome into rails 6.

This was [a very helpful guide for the rails setup](https://blog.makersacademy.com/how-to-install-bootstrap-and-jquery-on-rails-6-da6e810c1b87).

This was [a very helpful guide for setting up the layouts](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-bootstrap-to-a-ruby-on-rails-application).
